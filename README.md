This project provides an in-depth analysis of **voting patterns** in the 2024 S√£o Paulo municipal elections, with a focus on the **first and second rounds** of mayoral and city council races. It examines key aspects such as **voter behavior**, **shifts between rounds**, and **regional variations in voter turnout**. 

**The dataset was [***manually compiled from official sources***]()** , includes over **15,000 entries**. To gather relevant data, the project employed **web scraping** techniques, followed by **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. These methods uncover valuable insights into electoral trends and provide **strategic guidance** for understanding the political dynamics of S√£o Paulo, which can inform **future election strategies**


This work was developed as part of the **Integrated Project and Storytelling** course in the second semester of the undergraduate program in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **PUC-SP** in 2024, under the mentorship of the renowned  Professor [‚ú® Rooney Ribeiro Albuquerque Coelho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rooney-coelho-320857182/) 

His **expertise** and **unwavering dedication** to teaching played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of both **data science** and the **art of storytelling**.

- A geographic vote distribution showing high concentration in central S√£o Paulo and greater support for progressive parties in peripheral areas.


## 7. Charts and Dashboards
   
### 7.1. Vote Distribution by Municipality

The votes distribution revealed a large concentration in S√£o Paulo and neighboring urban areas. The analysis indicated the need for specific strategies for peripheral areas.

```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Reading the dataset
election = pd.read_csv('/path/to/your/data.csv', encoding='latin-1')

# Plotting vote distribution by municipality
fig = px.histogram(election, x="NM_MUNICIPIO", y="QT_VOTOS", 
                   title="Votes by Municipality", 
                   color_discrete_sequence=["#1f77b4"])
fig.update_layout(bargap=0.2)
fig.show()
```

<br>

### 7.2. Most Voted Mayoral Candidates

Ricardo Nunes (MDB) stood out in central zones, while Guilherme Boulos (PSOL) had strong support in the peripheries.

```python
# Filtering mayoral candidates
mayor = election[(election["DS_CARGO_PERGUNTA"] == "Prefeito") & 
                 (election["NM_MUNICIPIO"] == "S√ÉO PAULO") & 
                 (election["SG_PARTIDO"] != "#NULO#")].copy()

# Grouping and ordering candidates by votes
mayor = mayor.groupby(['NM_VOTAVEL', 'SG_PARTIDO']).sum().sort_values("QT_VOTOS", ascending=False)["QT_VOTOS"].reset_index()

# Calculating vote percentages
total_votes = mayor["QT_VOTOS"].sum()
mayor["PERCENTAGE"] = mayor["QT_VOTOS"] / total_votes

# Bar chart
fig = px.bar(mayor, x="NM_VOTAVEL", y="QT_VOTOS", color="SG_PARTIDO", 
             title="Most Voted Mayoral Candidates", 
             color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Dark24)

## 9. Conclusion

The analysis of the 2024 S√£o Paulo municipal election data provided valuable insights into voter behavior and emerging trends. We observed increasing political polarization, with PSOL gaining strength in peripheral areas and MDB maintaining a solid base in central urban areas. Additionally, the analysis revealed a shift in electoral preferences, with growing support for more progressive parties, especially among younger voters and lower social classes.

The analysis of charts and dashboards enabled a more detailed understanding of vote distribution by geography, candidate performance by electoral zone, and vote segmentation by party and demographic profile. The trends observed suggest that future electoral campaigns should focus on more segmented strategies, considering the social and economic characteristics of each region.

### Recommendations for future campaigns:

- **Personalize electoral communication** for different regions, considering demographic and socioeconomic profiles.
- **Leverage the growth of social media** and other digital platforms to connect with younger voters and those with limited access to traditional media.
- **Tailor campaign proposals** according to local issues such as security, health, and education, which were decisive factors for votes in various peripheral zones.
